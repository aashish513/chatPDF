# chatPDF

Welcome to the **chatPDF** repository! This project implements Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to query PDF documents via the Gemini API. Below you will find information on the project, its purpose, and how to use it.

## Overview

**chatPDF** is an IPython notebook (`.ipynb`) demonstrating the implementation of the RAG approach on a PDF document sourced from an online link. The notebook uses RAG to augment the retrieval capabilities of language models by allowing them to query specific document content directly.

### What is Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that provides a Language Model (LLM) with access to specific documents or datasets to generate responses based explicitly on the provided content. This approach allows for:

- **Bypassing Token Context Window Limits:** RAG enables the LLM to access large amounts of information beyond its inherent token limits.
- **Direct Knowledge Integration:** Instead of training the LLM on specific data, RAG integrates external knowledge by querying the relevant document during the response generation process.

### Motivation

RAG systems are beneficial for several reasons:

- **Extended Contextual Understanding:** RAG provides a method to overcome the limitations of token context windows in LLMs, enabling the model to handle more extensive and relevant information.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Integration:** It allows the integration of specific knowledge into the LLMâ€™s responses without needing to retrain or fine-tune the model on the entire dataset.

## Features

- **PDF Retrieval:** Fetches and processes PDF documents from an online link.
- **Query Processing:** Uses the Gemini API to generate responses based on the retrieved PDF content.
- **Interactive Notebook:** Provides a hands-on demonstration of the RAG approach within an IPython notebook.
